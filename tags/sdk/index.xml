      <description>I had to reset my NextThing Co C.H.I.P. because I had lost access. This turned out to be a lot more fun than expected.
NextThing as a company is no more, their docs and github repo&amp;rsquo;s are gone. So how can we flash out Chip?
First things first - there&amp;rsquo;s a docs mirror at http://chip.jfpossibilities.com/docs/chip.html#flash-chip-firmware
Do not bother trying to get the official SDK up an running, because after hours of trying and finally getting it all to work, it still doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.</description>
