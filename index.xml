      <description>Scrolling in tmux is best done with mouse-mode enabled, or in copy-mode.
Before entering copy mode you should run the command :set-window-option mode-keys vi to let you scroll in copy-mode with C-u and C-d as well as J and K (Shift-j and Shift-k). To be able to enter commands in tmux you have to first press C-b.
To enter copy-mode you should do C-b [, but this doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work for me (keyboard layout problems?</description>

      <description>Nix is a functional package manager and it has some learning curve. Nix should allow you to install packages (or environments) in parallel which do not interfere with eachother. Installing a package should never be able to break anything on your machine. I hope.
So I feel like I should just jump in an play with it.
I&amp;rsquo;ve already installed the Nix pkg manager for macOS from https://nixos.org/nix/ Now what?</description>

      <description>This is the first post written with Hugo. If you are me and I have forgotten how to do update this page, well then, you&amp;rsquo;re in luck.
# clone blog repo git clone https://github.com/flipb/blog.git cd blog ## make sure the submodules get initialized, ## not sure if this requires non-defaults in git? This sounds like a good second post.. # Update post vim content/posts/hello-world.md # check it out (should probably start this in a different terminal) # Note -D means it&#39;ll shoe Drafts # http://localhost:1313/ hugo server -D # ^c # create a new post hugo new content/posts/git-submodules-default-overrides.</description>
